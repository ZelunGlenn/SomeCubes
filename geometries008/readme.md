Segement:
* default 1 so the a flat square surface will have 1 line cross it, etc.


there are different geometries and they have a lot different properties in three website


Buffer geometry

when create that we need Float32Array: each three numbers is a single vertice (x, y, z)

This float array will then be a threeJS bufferAttribute with each three numbers as a single vertice

then set this attribute as position attribute for the buffer geometry

then do the rest. like adding material and then conbine as a mesh then add to the scene ...
